# Dragonhoard

Dragonhoard is an inventory management tool. There is no hierarchy in dragonhoard, every user has the same permissions. You own your items, but you can request items from other people, and become the "holder" of te item. Dragonhoard was made for a shared inventory for Dungeons and Dragons, where we can share minis, battlemats and those kinds of things. Of course this can be used for any sort of inventory, or even a digital record for RPGs.

## Hosting
The idea behind Dragonhoard is that everyone can download it and host it themselves. You can alter the source code and build the image yourself, or host it by running it directly. In the future there will also be an image hosted on the docker hub. It is built on top of a postgres database so ensure there is one running there as well.

Personally I have hosted an instance on fly.io, which works perfectly.

## Contributing
To contribute, you can just open an MR. Try to follow the code styling that has already been established in the rest of the codebase.
