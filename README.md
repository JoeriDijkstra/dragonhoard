# Dragonhoard

Dragonhoard is an inventory management tool. There is no hierarchy in dragonhoard, every user has the same permissions. You own your items, but you can request items from other people, and become the "holder" of te item. 

Dragonhoard was made for a shared inventory for Dungeons and Dragons, where we can share minis, battlemats and those kinds of things.

## Hosting
The idea behind Dragonhoard is that everyone can download it and host it themselves.
